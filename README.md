# Portfolio of the UX Design - Katherine Wearing - 

I've built the website porfolio based on her design and comps.

I've used Wordpress and the RED starter theme.

I could customize the theme and implement a taxonomy for her projects as you may see on the "Work" page. So the website administrator can be able to add more projects thru the dashboard and at same time categorize them accordingly the taxonomy.

I've used jQuery functions to implement the "smooth scrolling"effect and to the "sticky menu". In the "sticky menu" task I used some CSS transition effects in order to highlight the nav bar.

On the CSS I've used flebox to align the placeholders of the categories in the "Work" page.

The website is responsive for 3 breakpoints (mobile, tablet and desktop), however I had to implement one more breakpoint specifically for Iphones using "max-device-width".
